							<p>The advancement of technological tools and their use in the daily lives of our lives forces the operators of the right to update themselves to the new reality. </p>
							<p>In this sense, knowledge related to cybercrime becomes essential for the exercise of defense, since criminal investigations incorporate digital evidence in the criminal process, attempting to support their accusation. </p>
							<p>Technological crimes present in their figure such a specificity that it permeates the entire criminal investigation. This specificity responds, mainly, to the accusation of violation of criminal regulations, mediating the use of technological tools (online fraud, identity theft, data kidnapping, etc.). </p>
							<p>This requires specialized knowledge in cybercrime in order to adequately incorporate digital evidence into the criminal process, thus allowing a defensive technical approach in accordance with the requirements of the criminal type.</p>
							<p>However, technical knowledge of digital tools is required - not only - to address technological crimes, but also for all criminal cases. This is because, in a society - such as the current one - in which technology is used for daily activities, the evidence to be incorporated in all criminal proceedings is, precisely, of a digital nature (WhatsApp conversations, profiles of social networks, publications in product sales applications, etc.). </p>
							<p>This is why we offer specialized representation in the proper incorporation of digital evidence into the criminal process, in such a way that it safeguards its authenticity and validity, ensuring the effective exercise of the right of defense.</p>
