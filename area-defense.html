							<p>Every person suspected of an alleged criminal act has the right - from the first moment they realize they are being investigated - to designate a defense of their confidence. </p>
							<p>Our studio is characterized by offering personalized advice. Assuming an appropriate defensive strategy, in accordance with the theory of the case that the situation warrants. </p>
							<p>Situations that allow one to presume that one is the subject of a criminal investigation are, for example, becoming aware that a complaint has been made against one, a search of one's home, a court summons, an inhibition of goods, a prohibition of approach, among others. In these cases, it is essential to resort as soon as possible to a defense that provides comprehensive advice. </p>
							<p> This will allow us to outline a defensive strategy that protects the rights of the person, their property and their honor in an effective manner from the beginning of the case. </p>
							<p>For this reason, our studio offers personalized advice. Assuming an appropriate defensive strategy, in accordance with the theory of the case that the situation warrants.</p>
